From the home page, you can access all of the different webpages on our site by clicking on the different tabs at the top of the homepage.
The "Add Release" tab will allow the user to add the brand, model, colorway, and release date of a shoe that they would like to track the release of.

Example:
    Brand: Nike
    Model: Air Max 90
    Colorway: Nordic
    Release Date: 12/07/2020

After adding the sneaker release, the website will redirect to the "Upcoming Releases" page which will show a table of the upcoming releases that the user has entered ordered by release date.
Once a release date passes, the user can view the sneaker release information by clicking on "Past Releases" which also orders the sneakers by release date in a table.

Another feature on our website is the option to create your own collection of shoes.
By using the "Add Sneaker" page, the user can enter the brand, model, and colorway of a shoe and then this shoe will be added to the users "Collection".

By clicking on "Collection", the user can view all of the shoes that they have entered with the "Add Sneaker" page in alphabetical order by brand name within a table.

On the "Community" page, the webpage shows all of the collections for each user on the site.
