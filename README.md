# SneakerSchedule
Class project from CPSC 100 (Introduction to Computing and Programming) - Fall 2020

Developed an online website calendar that allows users to keep track of upcoming sneaker release dates

Coded using HTML, CSS, and MySQL.


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you keep track of sneaker releases you are interested in.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will allow the user to keep a running log of the upcoming sneaker releases they are interested in.
It will require users to create an account and login so that each sneaker log is personal to that user.
Logging in will direct the user to an informational home page with buttons leading to separate pages to add shoe releases and check their release log.
The "Add Sneaker" function will use forms where users input information about the shoe release like its brand, model name, colorway, release date, time, and price.
The running log should update so that when a sneaker's release date and time passes it is removed from the upcoming releases log (or moved to a "Past Releases" log).
Another feature we are hoping to add is a webpage of links to sneaker release information websites and sites where users can purchase sneakers (StockX, GOAT, etc.).
Another feature we are hoping to add is allowing users to add sneakers they own to a "Collection" list/webpage.
Another feature we are hoping to add is allowing users to see a list of other users' sneaker collections.
This will all be executed through a website using HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, and possibly JavaScript.
